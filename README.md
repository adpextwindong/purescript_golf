# purescript_golf
Golfin javascript stuff from my ongoing projects into purescript

## Dependencies
- [purescript](https://github.com/purescript/purescript)
- [spago](https://github.com/purescript/spago)

NPM install should handle these. If you're on cygwin its probably just best to stick the spago release executable in your path.

## Build
```
spago build
```

### Stuff thats in here

[RoseTree implementation](/src/RoseTree.purs) to replace my [LastViewer's Tree type](https://github.com/adpextwindong/Last-Viewer/blob/master/src/types/tree.js).
